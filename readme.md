# My Photography Journey
While we saw a lot of beautiful photos published by other professional photographer, it's always more fun when we take the photos by myself. A beautiful photo is not only a picture, it's also a memory. When we looked at a picture, a lot of memory surface up. It remind me the place where I took the picture, the time when I saw the scene. I even could smell the flowers.
